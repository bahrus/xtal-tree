# \<xtal-tree\>

\<xtal-tree\> is a dependency free web component that provides  a flat, virtual snapshot of a tree.  It is ~1kb, gzipped and minified.

Often we want to take advantage of a nice flat list generator component, like dom-repeat, or iron-list, but we want to use it to display and manipulate tree data.

This scenario seems to come up so frequently with various components, that this component strives to genericize that requirement.

xtal-tree takes a "watcha-got?" approach to the data -- it allows the specific structure of the tree data to be pretty much anything, and passes no judgement on it.   It doesn't accidentally overwrite anything it shouldn't, without specific permission from the developer. The user of xtal-tree, ie the developer, then needs to train xtal-tree how to interpret the data -- how to get the children, how to represent an open node vs a closed node, etc.

xtal-tree also takes a "whatcha-want?" approach to what is displayed.  You can display the data as a classic tree, or as a treegrid, or as any other way you want.  The only assumption xtal-tree makes is that you want to build the display from a flat list generator, like dom-repeat, iron-list, or a flat grid.  

Think of xtal-tree is a reusable "View Model" component.

The markup xtal-tree expects looks like this:

```html
    <xtal-tree 
        is-open-fn="[[isOpenFn]]" 
        children-fn = "[[childrenFn]]" 
        toggle-node-fn="[[toggleNodeFn]]"
        level-setter-fn="[[levelSetterFn]]"
        test-node-fn="[[testNodeFn]]"
        nodes="[[directory]]"
        search-string="[[search]]"
        viewable-nodes="{{viewableNodes}}"
    >
    </xtal-tree>
```

The properties required to show a tree are isOpenFn, childrenFn and nodes (that has the actual data).   The viewableNodes property / change event tells other components what flat array of nodes need to display and in what order, and the list changes as nodes are opened / closed, searched, sorted.

Let's illustrate via the code used in the demo.  For the demo, we want to display the names of the folders of a typical bower_components directory.

The structure of the file looks as follows:

```JSON
[
  {
    "path": "./bower_components",
    "name": "bower_components",
    "children": [
      {
        "path": "bower_components/accessibility-developer-tools",
        "name": "accessibility-developer-tools",
        "children": [
            {"etc": "etc"}
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

(Note:  This example and file was generated by a member of the Vaadin team.)

So now as a consumer of xtal-tree, we need to define custom functions to help interpret this data:

```JavaScript
    isOpenFn: function(node){
        return node.expanded;
    },
    childrenFn: function(node){
        return node.children;
    },
    toggleNodeFn:function(node){
        node.expanded = !node.expanded;
    },
```

These functions need to be passed to the xtal-tree instance, so it can recreate the flat list as users expand / collapse nodes. 

To specify a node needs to be toggled (opened / closed), you can pass it declaratively or programmatically.  Here we show it done programmatically:

```JavaScript
this.$.myTree.toggledNode = node;   
```

The toggleNodeFn property is an optional function property that allows one to add a toggle ability to the tree.  Applying the toggleNodeFn repeatedly to a node should cause the isOpenFn function to toggle between true and false when applied to the same node. 

### Other properties  

The levelSetterFn property is an optional function property that, if provided, then xtal-tree will apply markers to all the nodes, so the flat list generator can show indendation (for example).

The test-node-fn property is also an optional function property that allows a search of the tree to be done, based on the value of searchString.

The compare-fn property is also an optional function property that specifies how to compare two nodes, for sorting purposes.  The sorted property, not shown in the markup above, indicates whether the sort should be ascending ('asc') or descending ('desc').

With the respect to the search, this github repo contains another web component, xtal-split, which is a ~500 byte dependency free web component that will split text into regions (spans) matching a search string.  Those spans can be styled to highlight the text that matches the search.

### Super Advanced

Sometimes we want our tree to support node selection.  This is a particularly complex requirement, if you want to indicate partial selection, and if you want selections to cascade up and down the tree for logical consistency.

This is where the 800 byte (gzipped and minified) dependency free web component xtal-cascade fits in.
